# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-25

### Changed
- The description now says "easy to read and structured": "A reply rule that keeps answers easy to read and structured, stays honest, and avoids overwhelming you." It changes everywhere the 0.1.2 description was.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-25

### Changed
- One description everywhere: "A reply rule that keeps answers easy to read, stays honest, and avoids overwhelming you." It is in `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, the output style's frontmatter and the first line of both READMEs, and it no longer puts Claude Code first.
- README shows complete, untrimmed output, re-run with the 0.1.1 rules and with `CLAUDE.md` files disabled on both sides.
- `examples/` has the new raw outputs, the first batch, and all 20 repeat runs. It lists the misses.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-25

### Removed
- The Research and Development sections of the output style. They are work habits, not reply rules, so the plugin now holds reply rules only: about me, honesty, replies and asking. I moved the two sections to my own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

### Fixed
- The README rules table said "one question". The rule only says that questions go last.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-25

First public release.

### Added
- The plugin: my personal preferences, loaded as a forced output style (`plugin/output-styles/i-am-overwhelmed.md`) so they are in the system prompt of every session.
- `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md`, built on real before-and-after output.
- `examples/`: the raw outputs behind the README, the fixture, and what to know before trusting them.
